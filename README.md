# moby-dick Whale Detection

 Feature extraction, HMMs, Neural Nets, and Boosting for [Kaggle Cornell Whale detection challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/whale-detection-challenge).

## Results and Evaluation

We achieve a best mean result of 0.9786 roc-auc after with a 0.0014 standard
 deviation when running 10 fold cross validation using 10% of data for testing.
 This result could probably be improved by ensembling the neural net with
 the gradient boosted trees. Another untested option is to give the neural network
 some of the features used with the gradient booster as additional inputs.
